        <h1>ghostses</h1>
        <h3>a duo</h3>
        <div></div>
        <div>each performer reads and has a batterie of instruments including:
        <ul><li>an assortment of tuning forks (random pitches)</li>
            <li>an am/fm radio</li>
            <li>a harmonica or similar reed instrument</li>
            <li>a kitchen timer/bell</li>
            <li>a variety of little percussion instruments (rocks, toys, etc.)</li></ul></div>

        <h3>the corpus</h3>
        <div><p>an excerpt of any text written by W.G. Sebald. initial performances used most of Chapter 1 from The Rings of Saturn.

        <br/><br/>the corpus is separated into multiple files (layers) via a Python program. one layer contains all text (the background layer) and is printed on white paper while numerous foreground layers contain filtered, colored portions of the text (currently organized into parts of speech) printed on transparencies. performers assign a category from their batterie to each foreground layer (for example: nouns refer to radio, verbs to tuning forks, etc.).</p></div>

        <h3>stack(s)</h3>
        <div><p>a stack is created by combining (stacking) two or more foreground layers on top of a background layer (all from the same page). progression through each stack is dictated by each performer's silent reading of the background layer (normal reading rate [top to bottom, left to right], not/loosely coordinated). though layers of a stack must be from the same page, a sequence of stacks may be arranged in any order.

        <br/><br/>for example, a possible page 1 stack (with background, adjective, noun, and symbol layers):</p>

        <img src='/score_generator/ghostses_nns_adj_symb_reszd.jpg'/></div>

        <p>performers are encouraged to change the number and selection of foreground layers for each section.</p>

        <h3>action(s)</h3>
        <div><p>performers execute an action when they arrive at a word on the background sheet that intersects with that same word on a foreground sheet, simultaneously reading that word aloud and up to one or two words directly proceeding and/or following (or both proceeding and following). reading volume and the volume of ones action should be generally balanced/nearly even.

        <br/><br/>actions are dictated by pairs of words on the same foreground sheet. for example:</p>

        <img src="/score_generator/example.png"/></div>

        <p>the first noun (Janine) indicates the start of radio action, which may continue until a second noun (surgeon), the utterance of which demarcates an end to radio action.</p>

        <p>certain actions something something special requirements or techniques or whatever</p>

        <p>symbols/percussion - > do not read aloud</p>

        <p>a loosely coordinated distortion.</p>


        each page is almost like a movement, opportunity to reset
        pages are read top to bottom, left to right, however sequences of pages may be in any order

        symmetries...there is a small window where subtle/natural differences are held closely together...produces fuzziness

        radios -> change station after each off

        tuning forks need resonators

        complications
        (forthcoming)

        if synchonicity of X:
            loop
