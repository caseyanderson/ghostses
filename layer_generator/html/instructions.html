        <h1>ghostses</h1>
        <h3>a duo</h3>
        <div></div>
        <div>each performer reads and plays a batterie of instruments including:
        <ul><li>an assortment of tuning forks (random pitches) and acoustic resonators</li>
            <li>an am/fm radio</li>
            <li>a harmonica or similar reed instrument</li>
            <li>a kitchen timer/bell</li>
            <li>a variety of little percussion instruments (rocks, toys, etc.)</li></ul></div>

        <h3>the corpus</h3>
        <div><p>an excerpt of a text by W.G. Sebald. initial performances used most of Chapter 1 from The Rings of Saturn.

        <br/><br/>the corpus is separated into multiple files (layers) via a Python program. one layer contains all text (the background layer) and is printed on white paper. numerous foreground layers contain filtered, colored portions of the text (currently organized into parts of speech) printed on transparencies.</p></div>

        <h3>stack(s)</h3>
        <div><p>a stack is created by combining (stacking) two or more foreground layers on top of a background layer. for example, a possible page 1 stack (with background, adjective, noun, and symbol layers):</p>

        <p><img src='/imgs/ghostses_nns_adj_symb_reszd.jpg'/></p>

        <p>performers are encouraged to change the number and selection of foreground layers for each stack.  a sequence of stacks may be arranged in any order.</p></div>

        <h3>reading (silently, aloud)</h3>
        <div><p>progression through each stack is dictated by each performer's silent reading of the background layer (normal reading rate, normal progression through the page [top to bottom, left to right], reading rate not/loosely coordinated). upon arriving at a word on a foreground layer, performers read that word aloud and up to one or two words directly proceeding and/or following (or both proceeding and following). reading volume of both performers should be generally balanced/nearly even.</p></div>

        <h3>action(s)</h3>
        <div><p>performers assign a category from their batterie to each foreground layer (for example: nouns refer to radio, verbs to tuning forks, etc.). upon arriving at a word on a foreground layer performers execute the corresponding action and simultaneously read that word aloud. reading volume and the volume of ones action should be generally balanced/nearly even.

        <br/><br/>the duration of each action is dictated by each performer's silent reading of the background layer as well as the distance between pairs of words on the same foreground layer. for example (assuming nouns are radios):</p>

        <p><img src="/imgs/example.png"/></p>

        <p>the first noun (Janine) indicates the start of radio action, which continues until a second noun (surgeon), the utterance of which demarcates an end to radio action.</p></div>

        <h3>exceptions, additions</h3>
        <div><p>the symbols/punctuation layer is the only layer wherein marks on the transparency are not read aloud.</p>
        <p>radios with mechanical tuning dials, in which the station may be changed while the radio is off, are preferred. change the dial after every "off."</p></div>

        <h3>complications</h3>
