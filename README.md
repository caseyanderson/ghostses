a duo

each performer reads and has a batterie of instruments including: an assortment of tuning forks, an am/fm radio, a harmonica, a kitchen timer, and a variety of little percussion instruments (rocks - toys).

Sections are comprised of the combination of two sheets: the background sheet and one of many foreground sheets. The background sheet is a static text printed on a sheet of paper. Foreground sheets indicate various actions and are printed on transparencies. Each performer creates a section by laying a foreground sheet on top of the background sheet and reading the two together. Switching sections is accomplished by switching foreground sheets.

progression through each section is dictated by each performer's silent reading of the background text (normal reading rate, not/loosely coordinated). performers execute actions when they arrive at a word on the background sheet that intersects with a mark (or marks) on a foreground sheet.

A section is over when a performer reaches the end of the background sheet.

notes to Bill and David:

Okay, here is a draft (its the entire first chapter, i will cut down text over the next few days).

The one that is the entire text (black ink) is to be printed on normal 8.5x11 white paper

The rest of the files are color printouts that need to be printed onto 8.5x11 transparencies…

Each person has a dossier containing the white papers and free/unequal amounts of transparencies per page (number of transparencies = orchestration/number of “instruments”).

Assign a transparency sheet to an item from your battery (example: nouns = radio)…so, if you are looking at the nouns transparencies, lay noun transparency one over white paper one…read though the transparency silently (loosely coordinated…don’t try to do it at the exact same time but do try to avoid getting super far away from each other…i want it to be kind of fuzzy, the difference in your personal silent reading speeds will lead to quasi-natural distortions and pushing/pulling)…when a word on a transparency (colored) intersects with a word you are reading through the transparency (should be SAME EXACT word at SAME EXACT location) you may read that word aloud (and up to one or two other words surrounding it (as you approach and pass the word) and do something (from your battery). Words are (for now) in pairs…Example:

"In August 1992, when the dog days”

so if radio is noun transparencies then look for pairs of nouns…the first noun of a pair is “on,” the second is “off” (this will be something i am thinking more about over the weekend so subject to change) so:

reading (silently): In [ ] 1992, when the [ ] [ ]"
playing: radio on radio off radio on...
speaking: August dog days

You are free to change how many transparencies you each are you using per page, you need not coordinate which transparencies you are using (certainly don’t do so all the time).

So, how confusing is this? Or does it make sense?

I have lots more styling work to do on the transparencies (id like these pages to be double spaced and to use a monospace typeface but cant figure that out yet) so that plus updated/more involved sets of rules are forthcoming. In the meantime let me know if you want to talk quickly about all of this.
