a duo

each performer reads and has a batterie of instruments including: an assortment of tuning forks, an am/fm radio, a harmonica, a kitchen timer, and a variety of little percussion instruments (rocks - toys).

Sections are comprised of the combination of two sheets: the background sheet and one of many foreground sheets. The background sheet is a static text printed on a sheet of paper. Foreground sheets indicate various actions and are printed on transparencies. Each performer creates a section by laying a foreground sheet on top of the background sheet and reading the two together. Switching sections is accomplished by switching foreground sheets.

progression through each section is dictated by each performer's silent reading of the background text (normal reading rate, not/loosely coordinated). performers execute actions when they arrive at a word on the background sheet that intersects with a mark (or marks) on a foreground sheet.

A section is over when a performer reaches the end of the background sheet.
